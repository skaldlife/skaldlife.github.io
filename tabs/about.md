The idea about Skald Life has been brewing for years. Finally I got to it during the shitty year of 2020 and the infamous lockdown. The idea is to share with people the things I enjoy. First of these things is cooking. I want to share with you all the Balkan food recipes I can think of in the authentic way. The way my mother and grandmothers did it their whole lives. Naturally we won't stop there and we will explore these recipes even further. Also if you see me throw in an hot dog idea or a chili con carne recipe in the mix please don't mid, but sometimes I need to take a break.

The point is this: whatever I cook and prepare it will be explained in the simplest way possible and I want you all to know one thing: if I can do it, YOU can also. I am not a chef or anything like that. I am just an ordinary guy that likes cooking and I think that preparing food isn't meant to be a science, but a ritual where people gather around the fire, stove or anything else, sit down, have a drink and just talk and enjoy each others company.

Thank you for being here and please don't hesitate to contact me and ask questions, send me recipe ideas or just give your feedback. I would really like to know how these recipes are working out for you. Just remember to have a good time and enjoy yourselves while preparing any of these recipes.

Dear reader / cooking enthusiast Welcome to Skald Life and I hope you will enjoy your stay.
